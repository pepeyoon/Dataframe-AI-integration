## User Behavior Analysis Using NLP and GPT-4 Turbo

### All outputs have been deleted due to privacy. 

This project’s objective is to analyze and better understand users’ behavior from a large dataset corresponding to app interactions data. We utilized NLP techniques to clean and analyze data and implemented state-of-the-art language models to understand queries better and deliver more insightful responses.

##Data Cleaning:
Cleaning the data is the first step of this project. We observed that the dataset contains lots of noise, including bot-generated responses, missing entries, and redundant information. To isolate authentic human interactions, we applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text extraction and processing. Through this step, we were able to obtain a valid and useful set of real-human interaction data.
##Utilizing NLP for Text Data:
We implemented Llama2 API at this phase, but it failed to understand the engineering prompt. Hence, we had to look for an alternative solution, and we found it in GPT-4 Turbo. The Turbo version provided us with the capability of understanding the prompts better and generating the required output effectively.
##Data Integration:
We integrated the cleaned text data with GPT-4 Turbo to gain valuable insights. Once the user’s text data and the AI’s responses are paired together through GPT-4 Turbo, we achieved a more comprehensive understanding of users’ concerns, preferences, and common queries.
##Analysis:
The output data serve as a valuable source of information about the commonly asked questions by the users and how the customer representatives responded to these queries. This kind of analysis will help our client design a more user-centered approach in their app development and service optimization process in the future.
